Hello everyone !  We will be adding more public domain comics to the app every week. This is an ongoing process, where we review the comics, remove all the advertising pages inside, and make sure that you are not distracted by anything when you read the comics.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 5vw">
In occasional cases, we will also digitally enchance the quality of the comic to give you a more enjoyable experience. Enjoy and Keep reading !
</p>
<p style="font-size: 5vw">
Keep in touch with us and write to us if you want any comic to be available faster on the app.  You can reach us at comixviewerapp@gmail.com
