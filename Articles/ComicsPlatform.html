Thanks for downloading this app ! Comixviewer is a first step in the journey of building a new comics platform , one that you'll be very happy to use.
We envision a future where there are no ads to interrupt you from reading comics.  Just a purchase at the cost of a cup of coffee is all you need to get started on this adventure.
Initially we will be providing all the public domain content , carefully curated and enhanced for you .

<p style="font-size: 5vw">
We are also working on a Comics Creator and Comics Publisher apps , that will complete this ecosystem for you.  Just like you tube for videos, this aims to be the go to location for creating and publishing comics.
Sounds interesting ? Like it or not, by installing this app, you are already a fellow member of this community, and there are so many ways you can help to make this project a success!
After all , no project ever succeeds without YOU !
